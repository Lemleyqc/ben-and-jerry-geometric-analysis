# Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Machine Analysis

This project models the expected number of tries to grab an ice cream tub from a vending machine using geometric distribution.

## Objectives
- Simulate the process and calculate the expected number of trials.
- Use real or simulated data to estimate parameters of the geometric distribution.

## How to Run
- Clone this repository or download the `geometric_analysis.py` file.
- Run the script in Python to see the simulation results.

## Results
- Theoretical success probability: \(p = 1/6\).
- Expected number of tries: \(E(X) = 6\).

## Future Enhancements
- Use real-world data from the vending machine.
- Compare theoretical results with empirical findings.
